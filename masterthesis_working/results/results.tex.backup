\section{identify supply chains}

\begin{description}
 \item[[ ]] use JPN MACH as center point, so find supply chain of METL, MINQ, MACH etc.
\end{description}

\section{absorption potential}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Here I discuss the abilities of rs to compensate a loss and how we could estimate it.
 \item Also, I try to introduce a law, correlation equation, sth. to find the most important property for estimation
\end{itemize}


\begin{description}
 \item[[ ]] plots with degree, X, alpha, shared neighbours, etc. 
 \item[[ ]]For Agg=1, do some kind of statistics. Is the upper right one usually the one with 
the highest change? Are these three good criterions? Find a kind of law maybe?
 \item[[ ]] Maybe apply other criteria? Some graph theory properties? 
\end{description}

\section{case studies}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Here some specific scenarios are examined in detail. The goal is to understand the systems behaviour and how the results are created.
 \item I will NOT show some fundamental laws, findings here (like linear response, phase transitions), because they are a general feature of the 
system which I dedicate an own section for.
\end{itemize}


\begin{description}
 \item[[ ]] describe scenario. choose one that is easily understood, but still a relevant result (not a random scenario). E.g. JPN MACH, which is the 
scenario that will lead me throuh my thesis
 \item[[ ]] show as an overview $\{p\}$ and {q} $\rightarrow$ introduction {p} and {q}
 \item[[ ]] show differences of LPG and LPS
 \item[[ ]] show pie charts of chosen ir $\rightarrow$ introduction pie charts
 \item[[ ]] explain behaviour
 \item[[ ]] identify forward effect here
 
\end{description}

\section{statistics}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Idea: In case studies, we identify rules/indices that determine possible compensators due to network properties. So we can 
create a ``law'' / ``equation'' to determine the most probable compensators. This result can be checked with this statistics section
\end{itemize}

\subsection{F(ir)}  

\begin{description}
 \item[[ ]] Plot F(country(rs)) and F(sector(rs)) LPG and LPS for regions and sectors.
 \item[[ ]] Identify differences from LPG and LPS, explain that behaviour. Show that F(LPG)<F(LPS)
 \item[[ ]] Mention not feasible runs
 \item[[ ]] What insights does it give? - first overview about results, identifies first estimates about important regions/sectors/regional sectors. 
Show position of rs we discussed in detail (case study) before. 
 \item[[ ]] Maybe aggregate results for regions and sectors and give a general result about ``impact value''
\end{description}

\subsection{comp\_ir(ir)}

\begin{description}
 \item[[ ]] Plot strongest compensator rs\_comp(rs) for LPG and LPS (Decide: max(p) or max($p_i*r$) as criterion?) 
 \item[[ ]] Order (as done already) in regions, but alsorder in sectors. 
 \item[[ ]] USA and China as stabilisators of the world economy 
 \item[[ ]] Maybe case-study the other compensators? Why are they important in that specific case?

\section{linear response}

\begin{description}
 \item[[ ]] Idea: In theory develop a rule / equation / law that hints at a linear response of the system. Maybe the ``expansion'' of the polyhedron, 
until it touches a hyperplane? In this chapter, show that this is the truth. 
 \item[[ ]] show plots F(pfix) and p(pfix) and linear regression. Show linearity
 \item[[ ]] mention nonlinear behaviour for small pfix (dealt with in the next chapter)
 \item[[ ]] Measure the slope F(pfix) / p(pfix) and connect it to some network properties - estimate the behaviour without actually doing the 
simulation.
 \item shows phase transition
 \item shows F(LPS)>F(LPG)
